#CS 6210 Project 3 - Refactoring GT Threads
##Sam Britt and Yohanes Suliantoro

To build, simply type `make`. To build with debugging symbols
enabled, giving a detailed print out of the execution, type `make
debug`. To clean the compiled files, type `make clean`.

The source for the user-level threads library is in `gtthreads/`
and a sample application linking against it is in `gtmatrix/`.
